### Language Identification using NLP

  **Language Identification using NLP**

 **Introduction:**

  This project focuses on building a language detection model using machine learning techniques. 
  It employs two approaches: Logistic Regression with TF-IDF vectorization and a Recurrent 
  Neural Network (LSTM). The goal is to identify the language of a given text input accurately.

**Goal:**

  The primary objective is to develop a model capable of correctly classifying the language of 
  text input from various languages.  The project explores different model architectures to 
  determine which achieves superior accuracy and performance.


**Description:**
  
   The project begins by importing necessary libraries (pandas, numpy, scikit-learn, 
   TensorFlow/Keras, matplotlib, seaborn, and regular expressions). It loads a dataset 
   containing text samples and corresponding language labels ("Language Detection.csv").  
  **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** is performed, including checking for missing values and 
   visualizing the distribution of languages in the dataset.
   
   The text data is preprocessed by cleaning it (converting to lowercase, removing non- 
   alphanumeric characters, and extra spaces).  

  Two different models are then trained:
   * **Logistic Regression with TF-IDF**:  The cleaned text is converted into numerical features 
   using TF-IDF vectorization. A Logistic Regression model is trained on this vectorized data, 
   and its accuracy, classification report, and confusion matrix are evaluated.

 * **LSTM Model**:

      The text data is tokenized, converted into sequences, and padded to ensure 
  uniform length. An LSTM model is trained on these sequences, and the same evaluation metrics 
  are calculated.

  The performance of both models is evaluated on a test dataset and also validated with sample 
  sentences.
    
**Skills:**
* **Data preprocessing** (cleaning, TF-IDF vectorization, tokenization, padding)
* **Machine Learning model** building and evaluation (Logistic Regression, LSTM)
* **Use of relevant libraries** (pandas, scikit-learn, TensorFlow/Keras, matplotlib, seaborn)
* **Model evaluation** using accuracy, classification reports, and confusion matrices
* **Text processing techniques** (Regular expressions)

**Metrics:**
   **The primary metric for evaluating model performance is accuracy. 
   **Classification reports** (precision, recall, F1-score) and confusion matrices are also used 
   to provide a more detailed performance analysis. The project presents the accuracy scores 
   for both the Logistic Regression and LSTM models.

* **Next Steps**:
  * **Hyperparameter Tuning**:  Further improve model accuracy by tuning the hyperparameters of 
       both Logistic Regression and LSTM (e.g., regularization strength for Logistic Regression, 
       number of units, layers, and epochs for LSTM).

  * **Model Comparison and Ensemble Methods**: Compare the performances of other classification 
      models (e.g., Naive Bayes, SVM, Random Forest) with the current models. Explore ensemble 
      methods (e.g., stacking, bagging, boosting) to combine the strengths of different models 
      and potentially achieve even higher accuracy.

  * **Data Augmentation**: Investigate data augmentation techniques to expand the training 
     dataset, especially for languages with fewer examples, which might improve the model's 
     ability to generalize.

  * **Deployment**: Deploy the best performing model for real-world use, perhaps using a web 
     application or an API.
